Intel® Edison Nixie Display Node.js Software
===========================================

This software is distributed as part of the
[Element14 Upcycle It Challenge](https://www.element14.com/community/community/design-challenges/upcycleit). 
It runs on an Intel® Edison, with PCF8574 I/O extenders to drive Nixie tubes in an old puls counter.

Its main purpose is to display, time, weather and other information on the Nixie display.
Details can be found at the [challenge blog](https://www.element14.com/community/community/design-challenges/upcycleit/blog/2017/03/22/upcycle-it-with-edison-upcycled-nixie-display-1-introduction).

The development process assumes that your target device is running a compatible version of
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and is accessible to the Intel XDK via a network
connection.
